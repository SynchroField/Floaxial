# Floaxial
A modification for Minecraft that adds block physics.

#Overview

 - Make any block a falling type (stone, dirt, water).

 - Blocks move smoothly like regular sand.
 
 - Sideways movement is also supported with 8 energy levels.

 - Focus in high performance rather than graphics.  Players want minimal loss in performance for large mod packs.

 - Tuning can have a big impact on performance.  Speed limits can be set for heavy processes like scanning for blocks.

 - Uses plain rendering instead of entities or block states.

See [Documentation](https://github.com/SynchroField/Floaxial/wiki) for more information.
